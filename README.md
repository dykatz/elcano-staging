# Welcome to the Elcano Project!

The [Elcano Project](http://elcanoproject.org) is an effort to design an open-source autonomous tricycle project.

This repository contains a special rewrite of the Elcano Project that does away with all of the cruft.

The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/elcano/elcano).
